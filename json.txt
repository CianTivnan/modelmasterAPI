This 1/72-scale kit can be assembled as either the Mk.IIc or Mk.IIb; newly molded wings for the Mk.IIb are included. Also included are a bomb rack, two bombs, an extra 45-gallon tank, the initial exhaust pipes and tailwheel.

  "Desc": "The F-35 Lightning II was developed mainly by the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Eight countries other than the United States participated in the development of this aircraft, and this particular version was developed for the Netherlands. The F-35 is divided into A, B and C types depending on the takeoff method. The A type is CTOL (normal takeoff type), the B type is STOVL (short-range takeoff/vertical landing), and C is the designation for ship-borne aircraft.  It is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft with a single engine (the output of which matches or surpasses fourth- or 4.5th-generation twin-engine fighters). It is now also equipped with a 360-degree-view operation system and helmet display, carrying more electronics than the F-22 Raptor. This kit builds into a replica of the F-35A deployed in the Royal Air Force 323rd Squadron in the Netherlands, with a special 70th-anniversary graphic of Diana, the goddess of the hunt, on the aircraft's tail. The kit will be 32.6cm long with a wingspan of 22.3cm when completed.",
